RabbitMQ `3.12.11` is a maintenance release in the `3.12.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html).

Please refer to the upgrade section from the [3.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.12.0)
if upgrading from a version prior to 3.12.0.

This release requires Erlang 25 and supports Erlang versions up to `26.1.x`.
[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) has more details on
Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

As of 3.12.0, RabbitMQ requires Erlang 25. Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.

Users upgrading from 3.11.x (or older releases) on Erlang 25 to 3.12.x on Erlang 26
(both RabbitMQ *and* Erlang are upgraded at the same time) **must** consult
the [v3.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.12.0) first.


## Changes Worth Mentioning

Release notes can be found on GitHub at [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.12.x/release-notes).


### Core Broker

#### Bug Fixes

 * Quorum queue declared when one of cluster nodes was down could trigger
   connection exceptions.

   GitHub issue: [#10007](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/10007)

 * Avoids a rare exception that could stop TCP socket writes on a client connection.

   GitHub issues: [#9991](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/9991), [#9803](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/discussions/9803)

#### Enhancements

 * Definition files that are virtual host-specific cannot be imported on boot. Such files will now be
   detected early and the import process will terminate after logging a more informative message.

   Previous the import process would run into an obscure exception.

   GitHub issues: [#10068](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/10068), [#10085](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/10085)


### AMQP 1.0 Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Several AMQP 1.0 application properties are now more correctly converted
   to AMQP 0-9-1 headers by cross-protocol Shovels.

   The priority property now populates an AMQP 1.0 header with the same name,
   per AMQP 1.0 spec.

   This is a **potentially breaking change**.

### Management Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * `DELETE /api/policies/{vhost}/{policy}` returned a 500 response instead of a 404 one
   when target virtual host did not exist.

   GitHub issue: [#9983](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/9983)
