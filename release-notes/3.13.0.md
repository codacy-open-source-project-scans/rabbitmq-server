## RabbitMQ 3.13.0

RabbitMQ `3.13.0` is a new feature release.

## Highlights

This release includes several new features, optimizations, and graduates (makes mandatory) a number of feature flags.

The user-facing areas that have seen the biggest improvements in this release are

* Classic queues use version 2 of the storage implementation (CQv2).
This should significantly improve performance.

This release also features many internal API improvements in preparation to 4.0
with [Khepri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huT-zmXvfuM).

See Compatibility Notes below to learn about breaking or potentially breaking changes in this release.

## Release Artifacts

RabbitMQ releases are distributed via [GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases).
[Debian](https://rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html) and [RPM packages](https://rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html) are available via Cloudsmith mirrors, as well as [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq).

[Community Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/), [Chocolatey package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rabbitmq), and the [Homebrew formula](https://rabbitmq.com/install-homebrew.html)
are other installation options. They are updated with a delay (usually a few days).


## Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 25.0](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later.
This introduces feature parity for x86- and ARM64-based CPUs: Erlang 25 offers the JIT and
[modern Flame Graph profiling](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/05/flame-graphs/) tooling
for both of those major CPU architectures.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang 25.x.

## Upgrading to 3.13

### Documentation guides on upgrades

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html)
for release notes of other releases.

### Required Feature Flags

TBD

### Mixed version cluster compatibility

RabbitMQ 3.13.0 nodes can run alongside `3.12.x` nodes. `3.12.x`-specific features can only be made available when all nodes in the cluster
upgrade to 3.13.0 or any other patch release in the new series.

While operating in mixed version mode, some aspects of the system may not behave as expected. The list of known behavior changes is covered below.
Once all nodes are upgraded to 3.13.0, these irregularities will go away.

Mixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and are not meant to be run for extended
periods of time (no more than a few hours).



## Compatibility Notes

TBD


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

Starting with this release, RabbitMQ requires Erlang 25.0 or later versions. Nodes **will fail to start**
on older Erlang releases.

Erlang 25 as our new baseline means much improved performance on ARM64 architectures, [profiling with flame graphs](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/05/flame-graphs/)
across all architectures, and the most recent TLS 1.3 implementation available to all RabbitMQ 3.11 users.


### Client Library Compatibility

Client libraries that were compatible with RabbitMQ `3.12.x` will be compatible with `3.13.0`.


### Getting Help

Any questions about this release, upgrades or RabbitMQ in general are welcome on the [RabbitMQ mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users).


## Changes Worth Mentioning

Release notes are kept under [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/main/release-notes).

### Core Server

#### Enhancements

 * Reduced memory footprint, improved memory use predictability and throughput of classic queues (version 2, or CQv2).
   This particularly benefits classic queues with longer backlogs.

   Classic queue v2 (CQv2) storage implementation **is now the default**. It is possible to switch
   the default back to CQv1 using `rabbitmq.conf`:

   ``` ini
   # uses CQv1 by default
   classic_queue.default_version = 1
   ```

   Individual queues can be declared by passing `x-queue-version` argument and/or through a `queue-version` policy.

#### Bug Fixes

This release includes all bug fixes shipped in the `3.12.x` series.


### Dependency Changes

TBD
